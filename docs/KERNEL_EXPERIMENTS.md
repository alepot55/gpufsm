# Kernel-design experiments — what we tried and what moved the needle

A living log of GPU worklist kernel variants and their measured outcomes (RTX 4070, sm_89).
Goal: characterize the work-efficient NFA worklist and find the path to SOTA-absolute
throughput. Skeptical-scientist rule: report negative results honestly; a tried-and-failed
optimization is knowledge. All numbers trace to `paper/data/*.csv` and are reproducible via
the cited scripts.

## Baseline regimes (established earlier)
- **Full-scan kernels are compute-bound (O(n²) eps-closure):** throughput ∝ 1/n²; memory-layout
  axes (`multistream_shared`, `_async`) are inert (`docs/RESULTS_COSTMODEL.md`). The cure is a
  work-efficient kernel.
- **Register worklist** (≤512 states, 1 thread/string): 15–170 Gbps — the fast small-automaton path.
- **`worklist_global`** (1 thread/string, global working set, no state cap): the scalable but
  under-parallelized large-automaton baseline.

## Active-set sparsity (premise measurement)
Real automata are extremely sparse-active (mean active states over a random run):
levenshtein **7** / 2787 (44 words), fermi **269** / 40786 (638 words), brill **1.5** / 42661
(667 words). This motivated testing whether the O(nwords) bitmap scan is wasteful.

## Experiments

### ✅ `worklist_warp` — block-parallel (one warp/string), 32 lanes partition the words
**Outcome: the win.** 3–9× over `worklist_global` on real automata at a GPU-saturating batch
(up to ~12× dense synthetic, up to ~180× at small batch). Source of the win is **occupancy /
parallelism** (Nsight: 17→57% occupancy, SM 1→16%), not memory. The speedup is **batch- and
density-dependent** (`paper/data/worklist_warp{,_batch}_rtx4070.csv`).

### ◐ `worklist_shared` — warp kernel, working set in shared memory (≤1536 states)
**Outcome: inert (0.99–1.10× vs `worklist_warp`).** Nsight explains it: the working set already
lives in L2 at 99.96% hit, so moving it to shared memory changes nothing. Memory-layout
privatization does not help once the kernel is work-efficient
(`paper/data/worklist_shared_rtx4070.csv`).

### ✗ `worklist_compact` — compacted active-ID frontier (O(active)), 1 thread/string
**Outcome: refuted hypothesis — barely beats the bitmap scan (0.8–1.5× vs `worklist_global`),
and far slower than `worklist_warp` (0.1–0.4×).** Measured: levenshtein 0.8× (worse), fermi
1.0–1.2×, brill 1.5× vs the 1-thread bitmap kernel. Why the O(active) advantage doesn't
materialize: skipping an empty 64-bit word in the bitmap scan is one load + branch (cheap), and
the bitmap's sequential/coalesced word access beats the compacted frontier's scattered state-ID
loads + per-transition `visited` test-and-set dedup. So word-scanning was never the bottleneck.

## Nsight characterization (`paper/data/nsight_rtx4070.csv`)
`worklist_warp` is **latency/instruction-bound, not memory-bound**: DRAM ≤2.25%, L2 hit ≥97.6%
even for brill's 17 MB CSR (≫ 6 MB L2), because all strings share the CSR and only a hot row
subset is touched per batch (stays L2-resident).

## Claim verifications (skeptical re-checks, 2026-06-26)
- **Warp beats hand-CUDA (NFA) is robust.** warp/cuda multistream = 1.11–1.13× (regret
  0.89–0.90×) across 3 seeds × {32,48,64} states, spread ±1% — not an artifact of one NFA.
  (The cost-model fit gave 0.63×; the *measured* 0.90× is the robust headline.)
- **DFA Triton-flatness = a per-program scalar ceiling**, not memory or parallelism. Triton DFA
  throughput ramps with batch (64→1.7, 256→6.6, 1024→18, 4096→24.7 Gbps) then **saturates at
  ~29 Gbps** by ~4k strings (16384→28.7), while CUDA keeps scaling (16384→428 Gbps). So Triton's
  flat ~29 Gbps regardless of table size is its tile/SPMD per-program scalar-gather ceiling
  (enough programs to fill the GPU, memory idle) — confirming the model-bound reading.
- **Cost model** predictive for CUDA (2.7% holdout) but not Triton (45%, unstable) — see
  `docs/RESULTS_COSTMODEL.md`; measured throughput ratio is the primary metric.
- **CAUSAL primitive ablation (within Triton).** Same language/data/harness/parallelism (one
  program/string), only the access pattern differs: tile-vectorized reduction vs a carried
  data-dependent scalar recurrence. At a saturating batch the tile kernel scales to **1320 Gbps**
  while the scalar pattern hits a hard **~81 Gbps** per-program ceiling — a **16× cliff** from the
  control pattern alone (`scripts/ablate_scalar_control.py`, `paper/data/scalar_ablation_rtx4070.csv`).
  This makes the capability→cost attribution *causal*: the regret appears iff the inexpressible
  scalar/control-flow primitive is required (the scalar ceiling mirrors the DFA Triton-flat result).

## Where this points (path to SOTA-absolute)
Neither memory layout (shared) nor work-reduction (compaction) is the lever; **parallelism**
(warp) is, and it's now in. The remaining gap to ngAP-class absolute throughput is **algorithmic
redundancy across strings/symbols**: memoization (reuse repeated state-set transitions),
non-blocking multi-symbol processing (ngAP), or cross-string CSR-access batching/coalescing.
That — not another data-layout tweak — is the next worthwhile kernel experiment.

## Reproduce
- warp/shared/compact correctness: `pytest tests/test_worklist_warp.py -m gpu`
- warp speedup + batch sensitivity: `python scripts/bench_worklist_warp.py`
- shared vs warp: `python scripts/bench_worklist_shared.py`
- compact vs global vs warp (the 3-way above): run `run_batch(nfa, batch, "cuda", t)` for
  `t in {worklist_global, worklist_warp, worklist_compact}` on the pinned ANMLZoo automata
  (`gpufsm.io.datasets.DATASETS`) at batch 256 and 4096; numbers above are medians of 5.
