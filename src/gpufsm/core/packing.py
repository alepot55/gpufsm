"""Host-side array packing shared by every GPU backend.

The Triton, CUDA and Warp executors all have to hand the device the same three
things: the input batch as a flat symbol buffer plus CSR-style offsets, the accept
set as a packed bitmask, and single inputs as an int32 symbol array. Each backend
used to carry its own copy of that code, which is how the copies drifted (int64 vs
uint64 accept words, an empty-batch guard present in some and missing in others).

Everything here is numpy-only, so it imports on a CPU-only machine and is covered
by the ordinary test suite rather than only by GPU runs.
