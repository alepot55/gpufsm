"""Predictive memory cost model — operationalizing "abstraction regret".

The thesis: for irregular NFA processing the Triton↔CUDA (and DSL↔DSL) gap is set by
the *memory layout a model can express*, not by algorithm or scheduling. To make that
claim testable rather than rhetorical, we model the **memory traffic moved per input
symbol** under each technique and predict throughput, then validate the predictions
against measured runs (see ``scripts``/sweep CSVs).

The model is deliberately simple (KISS) and analytic — two physically-meaningful
fitted constants, not a black box:

    time_per_symbol = traffic_bytes_per_symbol / eff_bandwidth
                    + num_states**2 * compute_s_per_state2

i.e. a roofline-style sum of a **memory term** (what the layout/technique changes) and
a **compute term** that is *quadratic* in num_states: the faithful constant-algorithm
kernel does an O(n) transition scan plus an O(n^2) epsilon-closure (n convergence
passes x n states) per input symbol. This was confirmed empirically — throughput
scales as 1/n^2; a linear compute term mis-fits (~85% error), the n^2 term fits well.

Consequence the model makes quantitative: while the dense full-scan kernel is
COMPUTE-bound, the memory term is negligible, so memory-layout techniques (shared CSR,
async, even byte->bit) barely move throughput — measured directly, multistream_shared
(modeled traffic = 0) ties multistream (traffic > 0). The "abstraction regret" (memory
layout) only bites once the algorithm is made work-efficient (sparse active-set /
worklist, as in ngAP) so memory becomes the bottleneck. The model thus predicts which
regime a kernel is in and the ceiling on what a memory technique can buy.

Byte-counting is deterministic and unit-tested on CPU; calibration/validation of the
two constants needs measured throughput (GPU), done from the sweep data.
